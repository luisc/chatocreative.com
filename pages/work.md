# Work

When spinning up a new project these days, I usually reach for a ruby related too, Rails, Sinatra, or Jekyll.

The majority of code I write today is related to inventory and event management. At Twenty Sided Store I have developed robust systems to process, manage and reorder inventory. At Twenty Sided Store we handle tens of thousands of SKUs. I have a custom app that integrates and syncs with Shopify and Slack. I have also written (and now deprecated) custom apps integrating with Square POS.

Prior to 2011, I wrote a lot of code. I have written production level code in:

* Ruby
* Javascript
* SQL
* Mivascript (obscure one)
* PHP
* Perl
* HTML
* CSS
* Liquid

## Sites

* Twenty Sided Store
* Grand St. BK
