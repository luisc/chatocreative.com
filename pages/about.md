## About

Since 2011, I have co-owned [Twenty Sided Store](https://twentysidedstore.com/), a retail and event space (sans event space during COVID) in Brooklyn, NY. I have done everything from helping and ringing out customers, writing inventory management software, baking cookies, knocking down drywall, putting up drywall, processing payroll, wading through kneedeep water to unflood a drain to... well you get the idea ;)

I like to read, listen to music, run, play games, and watch hoops.
